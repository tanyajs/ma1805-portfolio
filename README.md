# Description
Hello,
This is not my first time coding, however, i have never really enjoyed coding because i never understood it but i found this one particularly quite enjoyable because we were allowed to be creative in different ways through each of the prompts. 
Starting with Drawing, at the start I had to try get used to the codes and realised it really was rather simpler than i thought but it was still very confusing at the start which is why it is very basic..

Movement - this one was VERY repetitive because I watched the video you provided us with and then just tried to use that and make it my own not realising there was probably a quicker way than the way i did it because after i finished i noticed i could have researched a much faster way which lesson learnt for next time. This one is still very basic, i wanted to add a sunflower once the sun has full taken over the screen but i tried to search up how to time speed the next part to kind of sprout right after but it kept starting at the same time as the sun was developing and that was my biggest challenge as well as trying to pause it to not continue moving so i can add the other parts of the sunflower but unfortunately i couldnt find a way which was dissapointing.

Multiples -
